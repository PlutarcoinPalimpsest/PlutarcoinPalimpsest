## Welcome? :bowtie:
*I think?*

Helo there, I'm Plutarco in Palimpsest (internal joke... wiht myself)
A not so serious writer and programmer trying to be, well, serious.

- I'm working on building the myths, backstory, and main storyline for a book idea 😉
- Learning Mandarin (just for a novel) and Italian
- English is not my native language
- And... this place will probably be a little... (how can I say that?), empty??
Well, I'll upload any updates (refined ones) in worldbuilding, drawings, songs, and possible softwares for my worlds, but only those that met my criteria, so it'll take time (a lot of it)

**WELCOME (*again*) to Palimpsest, a fractured world where many stories and ideas take place**
Sit tight, be comfortable, and enjoy the ride 😁
